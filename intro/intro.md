##What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

1. Reading and writing
2. Attention to detail 
3. Spotting the differences 


In my own words this means....

1. Reading and writing is comprehensively understanding what is entailed with reading and writing quality code that is easy to understand for you 
and for others. Code should not be overly complex or contain and hidden characters or attributes. 

2. Attention to detail isn't just important but an absolute necessity to pay attention to all details, big and small. If you don't pay attention to details you will end up with bugs. 

3. Spotting the differences. The ability to spot differences big and small is what separates a good programmer from a great programmer. 
Those with more experience will be able to examine large amounts of code and easily decipher the differences.  

##Why do you need to not copy and paste?

Copying and pasting will get you nowhere in life in terms of learning. 
It is not a learning tool whatsoever and is a cheating tool instead. 
Cheaters never win (except the New England Patriots in 2014-2015). 

##Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Practice and persistence is the key to learning and mastering any new school. 
Any ancient rule says that once you do something 1,000 to 10,000 times, you can become a master of it. 
This means that a great number of hours and times failed will be required so that practice makes perfect. 
Frustration will be a natural part of the process so when you feel like giving up, do not go through with this feeling! Instead keep on practicing and staying the course until the finish line.
