# Chapter 0

Because you went through InstallFest, you can simply review the install steps, but you should already have everything you need to get started.

Since you have a Mac, skip the Windows and Linux sections of this page.

Changes in this chapter:
We will be using Ruby version 2.1.5
We will be using RubyMine instead of TextWrangler/Gedit
We will be using iTerm instead of Terminal

In the section "OS X: What You Should See", the author provides a copy of his Terminal output.  You should do the same, but add the output to a Readme.md file in the chapter_0 directory.

Bonus points if you can figure out how to make the Markdown output "look good".

Questions:

Provide a link in your Readme.md that links to the documentation for the following classes:

*  Array
##### http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.4/Array.html
*  Hash
##### http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.4/Hash.html
*  Chronic (Rubygem)
##### https://github.com/mojombo/chronic

Find two other relative links and add those to the Readme.md as well.
