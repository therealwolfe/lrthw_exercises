#### Chapter 1

http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex1.html

In this exercise, the author has you type the code into a file named ex1.rb.  You should put this file in the chapter_1 directory.

When you run the file by typing "ruby ex1.rb", make sure you are in the chapter_1 directory.  You can run `pwd` to make sure.

If you type the exercise as it's written in the chapter, Rubocop will complain about the double quoted strings.  

> In the Readme.md for this directory, explain how you got rid of the offenses.  

To get rid of the Rubocop offenses I changed the double qoutes to single quotes. 

> Did you fix the strings?  Or did you tell Rubocop to ignore those code style violations?  

I fixed the strings by doing what Rubocop requested. I did not tell Rubocop to ignore those codes! 

> Why did you pick what you did?

I picked what I did because of the different functions involved with single and double quotes. If I would have left it how it was, things would have gone wrong due to syntax errors. 

Please include the Study Drills stuff in your ex1.rb file.

> 1. Make your script print another line.
  2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
  3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. 
  4. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.

1. I added the line "I love Carrot Cake"
2. Using the # and by holding the option key down, I created an insert point so that it only printed the top line Hello World. 
3. I used the # (octothorpe) in #2 in order to hide all strings and only print one string. 
4. The # hides the strings and produces know output because it is now in comment form and not output form.
